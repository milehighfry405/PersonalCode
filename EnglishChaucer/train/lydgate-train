Whan brighte Phebus passed was the Ram
Myd of Aprille and into Bole cam,
And Satourn old with his frosty face
In Virgyne taken had his place,
Malencolik and slowgh of mocioun,
And was also in th'oposicioun
Of Lucina the mone moyst and pale,
That many shour fro hevene made avale;
Whan Aurora was in the morowe red,
And Jubiter in the Crabbes hed
Hath take his paleys and his mansioun;
The lusty tyme and joly fressh sesoun
Whan that Flora the noble myghty quene
The soyl hath clad in newe tendre grene,
With her floures craftyly ymeynt,
Braunch and bough with red and whit depeynt,
Fletinge the bawme on hillis and on valys;
The tyme in soth whan Canterbury talys
Complet and told at many sondry stage
Of estatis in the pilgrimage,
Everich man lik to his degré,
Some of desport, some of moralité,
Some of knyghthode, love, and gentillesse,
And some also of parfit holynesse,
And some also in soth of ribaudye
To make laughter in the companye
(Ech admitted, for non wold other greve)
Lich as the Cook, the Millere, and the Reve
Aquytte hemsilf, shortly to conclude,
Boystously in her teermes rude,
--**--**--
Whan thei hadde wel dronken of the bolle,
And ek also with his pylled nolle
The Pardowner beerdlees al his chyn,
Glasy-eyed and face of cherubyn,
Tellyng a tale to angre with the frere,
As opynly the storie kan yow lere
Word for word with every circumstaunce,
Echon ywrite and put in remembraunce
By hym that was, yif I shal not feyne,
Floure of poetes thorghout al Breteyne,
Which sothly hadde most of excellence
In rethorike and in eloquence
(Rede his making who list the trouthe fynde)
Which never shal appallen in my mynde
But alwey fressh ben in my memoyré,
To whom be gove pris, honure, and gloyré
Of wel seyinge first in oure language,
Chief registrer of this pilgrimage,
Al that was tolde forgeting noght at al,
Feyned talis nor thing historial,
With many proverbe divers and unkouth,
Be rehersaile of his sugrid mouth,
Of eche thyng keping in substaunce
The sentence hool withoute variance,
Voyding the chaf sothly for to seyn,
Enlumynyng the trewe piked greyn
Be crafty writinge of his sawes swete,
Fro the tyme that thei deden mete
First the pylgrimes sothly everichon,
At the Tabbard assembled on be on,
--**--**--
And fro Suthwerk shortly forto seye
To Canterbury ridyng on her weie,
Tellynge a tale as I reherce can,
Lich as the hoste assigned every man,
None so hardy his biddyng disobeye.
And this whil that the pilgrymes leye
At Canterbury wel logged on and all,
I not in soth what I may it call -
Hap or fortune in conclusioun -
That me byfil to entren into toun
The holy seynt pleynly to visite
After siknesse, my vowes to aquyte,
In a cope of blak and not of grene,
On a palfrey slender, long, and lene,
With rusty brydel mad nat for the sale,
My man toforn with a voide male,
Which of fortune took myn inne anon
Wher the pylgrymes were logged everichon,
The same tyme her governour, the Host,
Stonding in halle ful of wynde and bost,
Lich to a man wonder sterne and fers,
Which spak to me and seide anon, "Daun Pers,
Daun Domynyk, Dan Godfrey, or Clement,
Ye be welcom newly into Kent,
Thogh youre bridel have neither boos ne belle,
Besechinge you that ye wil me telle
First youre name and of what contré
Withoute mor shortely that ye be,
That loke so pale al devoyde of blood,
Upon youre hede a wonder thredbar hood,
--**--**--
Wel araied for to ride late."
I answerde my name was Lydgate,
"Monk of Bery, nygh fyfty yere of age,
Come to this toune to do my pilgrimage,
As I have hight. I ha therof no shame."
"Daun John," quod he, "wel broke ye youre name.
Thogh ye be soul, beth right glad and light,
Preiyng you soupe with us tonyght,
And ye shal han mad at youre devis
A gret puddyng or a rounde hagys,
A franchemole, a tansey, or a froyse;
To ben a monk, sclender is youre koyse;
Ye han be seke, I dar myn hede assure,
Or late fed in a feynt pasture.
Lift up youre hed, be glad, tak no sorowe!
And ye shal hom ride with us tomorowe,
I seye, whan ye rested han your fille.
Aftere soper slepe wil do non ille.
Wrappe wel youre hede with clothes rounde aboute.
Strong notty ale wol mak you to route.
Tak a pylow that ye lye not lowe;
Yif nede be, spare not to blowe!
To holde wynde, be myn opynyoun,
Wil engendre collik passioun
And make men to greven on her roppys,
Whan thei han filled her mawes and her croppys.
But toward nyght ete some fenel rede,
Annys, comyn, or coriandre sede.
And lik as I power have and myght,
I charge yow rise not at mydnyght,
--**--**--
Thogh it so be the moone shyne cler.
I wol mysilf be youre orloger
Tomorow erly, whan I se my tyme,
For we wol forth parcel afore pryme;
A company, pardé, shal do you good.
What? Look up, monk! For by kokkis blood,
Thow shalt be mery who so that sey nay.
For tomorowe, anoon as it is day
And that it gynne in the est to dawe,
Thow shalt be bound to a newe lawe
Att goyng oute of Canterbury toune
And leyn aside thy professioun.
Thow shalt not chese nor thisilf withdrawe,
Yif eny myrth be founden in thy mawe,
Lyk the custom of this compenye,
For non so proude that dar me denye,
Knyght nor knave, chanon, prest ne nonne,
To telle a tale pleynly as thei konne,
Whan I assigne and se tyme opportune.
And for that we our purpoos wil contune,
We wil homward the same custome use,
And thow shalt not platly thee excuse.
Be now wel war - stody wel tonyght!
But for al this, be of herte light!
Thy wit shal be the sharper and the bet."
And we anon were to soper set,
And served wel unto oure plesaunce,
And sone after be good governaunce
Unto bed goth every maner wight.
And towarde morowe anon as it was light,
--**--**--
Every pilgryme bothe bet and wors,
As bad oure hoste toke anon his hors,
Whan the sonne roos in the est ful clyere,
Fully in purpoos to come to dynere
Unto Osspryng and breke ther our faste.
And whan we weren from Canterbury paste
Noght the space of a bowe draught,
Our hoost in hast hath my bridel rauht
And to me seide as it were in game,
"Come forth, daun John, be your Cristene name,
And lat us make some manere myrth or play.
Shet youre portoos a twenty develway!
It is no disport so to patere and seie.
It wol make youre lippes wonder dreye.
Tel some tale, and make therof a jape.
For be my rouncy, thow shalt not eskape.
But preche not of non holynesse.
Gynne some tale of myrth or of gladnesse,
And nodde not with thyn hevy bekke.
Telle us some thyng that draweth to effecte
Only of joye. Make no lenger lette."
And whan I saugh it wolde be no bette,
I obeyde unto his biddynge,
So as the lawe me bonde in al thinge;
And as I coude with a pale cheere,
My tale I gan anon as ye shal here.
"Sirs," quod I, "sith of your curtesye
I entred am into your companye
And admitted a tale for to telle
By hym that hath power to compelle
--**--**--
(I mene our hoste, governour, and guyde
Of yow echon ridyng her beside),
Thogh that my wit barayn be and dul,
I wol reherce a story wonderful,
Towchinge the siege and destruccioun
Of worthy Thebees the myghty royal toun,
Bylt and begonne of olde antiquité,
Upon the tyme of worthy Josué,
Be dyligence of kyng Amphioun,
Chief cause first of his fundacioun,
For which his fame which nevere shal away,
In honure floureth yit unto this day,
And in story remembred is and preised.
But how the wallys weren on heghte reised,
It is wonder and merveil forto here.
But if ye list, I shal yow platly lere
The maner hool shortly in sentence,
Under support of youre pacience,
As writ myn auctour and Bochas bothe two.
Rede her bookes and ye shal fynde it so,
How this kyng, thys prudent Amphyoun,
With the swetnesse and melodious soun
And armonye of his swete song
The cyté bylt that whilom was so strong,
Be vertue only of the werbles sharpe
That he made in Mercuries harpe,
Of which the strenges were not touched softe,
Wherby the walles reised weren alofte,
Withoute craft of eny mannys hond,
Ful yoor agon myd of Grekes lond;
--**--**--
Which is a thing of poetes told,
Nevere yseyn neither of yong nor old.
But as Bochas list to specifie,
Cler expownyng this derke poysye,
Seith Mercurye, god of eloquence,
Gaf be the myght of hevenly influence
Unto this kyng at his nativité
Thorgh glade aspectes that he shulde be
Most excellent be craft of rethorik,
That in this world was non to hym lik;
Which signyfieth to hem that ben prudent
The musycal, the lusty instrument
(I mene the harpe most melodious),
Gove to this kynge be Mercurius;
And his song, this auctour can yow teche,
Was nothyng but the crafty speche
Of this kyng ycalled Amphioun;
Wherby he made the contrés envyroun
To han such lust in his wordes swete
That were so plesaunt, favourable, and mete
In her eerys that shortly ther was noon
Disobeysaunt with the kyng to goon,
Whersoevere that hym list assigne.
His cheer, his port was outward so benygne
That thorgh his styring and exortacioun
With hym they went to byld first this toun
And forsook ecch man his contré
Be on assent to make this cyté
Royal and riche that lich was nowher noon.
And thus the wallis made of lym and stoon
--**--**--
Were reysed first be syngyng of this kyng,
Lich as poetys feyne in her writyng,
Passyng rich and royal of entaille.
Her may ye see how myche may avaylle
The goodlihed and lownesse of a kyng,
And specealy in cher and in spekyng
To his lyeges and to bern hym fayre
In his apport and shewe hym debonayre
And nat to bene to straunge ne soleyn
In contenaunce outward be disdeyn;
Which causeth ofte, who that can adverte,
Grete hatred in the puples herte,
And therupon prively wol rowne,
Whan a prynce doth upon hem frowne,
Shortly deme for al his excellence,
Among hemsilf out of his presence,
Everych conclude lich his fantasye.
And thus ful ofte gendred is envye
In folkes hertes of soleynté and pryde,
For swich as list nat onys loke asyde
To reward hem whan they lowe loute.
And ageyn kynde it is, out of doute,
That eny hed be recorde of the wyse
Shuld the foot of disdeyn despyse
Which bereth hym up, who so can take hede,
And susteneth in his moste nede
As his pyler and his sowpowayle.
For fynaly ne wer the porayle
Her berer up and supportacioun,
Farwel lordshyp and domynacioun
--**--**--
Thorghoute the world of every hegh estat!
Wherfor me semeth mor is fortunat
Of Mercurye the soote sugred harpe
Than Mars swerd whetted kene and sharpe,
Mor accepted with asspectis goode
Than is this god with his lokes woode.
For humble speche with glad contenaunce
May a prynce sothly mor avaunce
Among his puple hertes forto wynne
Of inward love which that wol not twynne,
Than gold, rychesse, pride, or tyranye,
Oyther disdeyne, daunger, or surquedye.
For of lordes - clerkes can reporte -
But that love her crowne do supporte,
The fyn ys nought in conclusioun.
I take record of kyng Amphyoun
That bylte Thebes be his elloquence
Mor than of pride or of violence,
Noble and riche that lik was nowher non,
And thus the walles mad of lym and stoon
Were reised first be syngyng of this kyng,
Lich as poetes feyn in her wryting.
But sothly yit some expositours,
Groundyng hem upon olde auctours,
Seyn that Cadmus the famous olde man
Ful longe afor this cité first began,
And the ground of the bieldyng sette,
And the boundes be compas out he mette
With thong outkorve of a boolys hyde,
Whych envyroun strecche myghte wyde
--**--**--
To get inne londe a ful large space
Wherupon to byld a dwellyng place,
And called was the soyle thus geten inne
Whylom Boece of the bolys skynne.
The name after into Thebes turned.
But Cadmus ther hath longe not sojourned,
Lik in story as it is compyled;
For shortly he from thennys was exiled,
Never after to dwelle in this toun,
Be the knyghthode of this Amphioun,
Which up parformeth riche for the noonys
The cité Thebes of myghty squar stonys,
As I yow tolde a litil heretoforn;
And Cadmus thus hath his kyngdam lorn,
Sceptre and crowne and his powere royal.
Now have I told unto you ground of al,
That ye wel knowe be informacioun
Cleerly the pith and exposicioun
Of this mater, as clerkes can you telle.
It were but veyn lenger for to dwelle,
To tary yow as in this matiere,
Sith my tale which that ye shal here
Upon oure waie wil lasten a longe while,
The space as I suppose of seven myle.
And now ye know first how Amphyoun
Bylt and began this cité and this toun,
Regnyng ther long aftere, as I rede.
Of hym no more, for I wil procede
To my purpoos that I first began,
Not tellyng here how the lyne ran
--**--**--
From kyng to kyng be successioun,
Conveying doun the stok of Amphyoun
Cereously be lyneal discent;
But leve al this, pleynly of entent,
To telle forth, in bookes as I rede,
How Layus be processe gan succede
To bere the croune in this myghty lond,
Holdyng the sceptre of Thebes in his hond,
Manly and wys duryng al his liff.
And Jocasta called was his wyff,
Ful wommanly the story seith certeyn,
For a tyme thogh she were bareyn,
Tyl Layus in ful humble wise
To have a child did sacrifise
Fyrst t'Apollo in his char so bright
And Jubiter that hath so gret a myght,
Besechyng hem with devout reverence
To graunt only thorgh her influence
That his request may excecuted be;
And specially to goddesses thre
He besoughte - Pallas and Juno
And Dyane - forto helpe also
That he be not defrauded of his bone.
And his preyere accepted was ful sone,
That fynaly thorgh his ryytys olde,
Evene lik as his herte wolde,
The queene Jocasta hath anon conceyved.
Which, whan the kyng fully hath perceyved,
He made in hast, hym lyst not to abide,
Thorgh hys kyngdom massageres ryde
--**--**--
Fro coost to coost the story can devyse,
For dyvynoures and phylosophres wise,
For such as weren famous physiciens
And wel expert astronomyens
To come in hast unto his presence
To fynde out shortly in sentence,
By craft only of calculacioun,
The chyldes fate and disposicioun
And therupon to geve a jugement,
The root ytake at the ascendent,
Trewly sought out be mynut and degré,
The silfe houre of his natyvyté,
Not forgete the hevenly mansiouns
Clerly cerched be smale fracciouns,
First be secoundes, tiers, and eke quartes
On augrym stoones and on white caartes
Ypreved out be diligent labour,
In tables correcte devoyde of al errour,
Justly soght and founde out bothe twoo,
The yeeres collecte and expance also,
Consydred ek be good inspeccioun
Every hour and constellacioun
And eche aspecte and lookes ek dyvers,
Which were good and which also pervers,
Wher they were toward or ellys at debat,
Happy, welful, or infortunat.
And fynaly, in conclusyoun,
They founde Satourn in the Scorpioun,
Hevy-chered, malencolik and loth,
And woode Mars furious and wroth,
--**--**--
Holdyng his sceptre in the Capricorn,
The same hour whan this chyld was born,
Venus dejecte and contrarious
And depressed in Mercuryes hous;
That the dome and jugement fynal
Of thies clerkes, to speke in special,
Be fatal sort which may not be withdrawe,
That with his swerd his fader shal be slawe:
Ther may no man helpe it nor excuse.
On whiche thyng the kyng gan sore muse,
And cast he wolde on that other side
Agayn her doom for hymsilf provide,
Shape a way and remedy toforn,
Biddyng the queene whan the chyld were born,
Withoute mercy or moderly pyté,
That he be ded: that may non other be.
And in al hast lik as he hath sent,
She obeyed his comaundement.
With wooful herte and a pitous loke
And face pale, her yonge sone she toke,
Tendre and grene both of flessh and bonys,
To certeyn men ordeyned for the noonys
From poynt to poynt in al maner thing
To execute the biddyng of the kyng.
They durste not delay it nor abide,
But to a forest that stood fer besyde,
They took her wey and faste gan hem spede
The kyngges wille to parforme in dede,
Havyng therof passyng hevynesse.
But whan that they beheelden the fairnesse
--**--**--
Of the chyld and excellent beauté,
In her herte they hadde grete pyté
And pleynly cast - among hem was no stryf -
That the child shulde han his lif.
And anon ful hygh upon a tre,
In a place that no man myght se,
They henge hym up, the story kan reherce.
But first his feet thorgh they gan to perce,
And on bowes tendre, tough, and smale,
They knet hym up shortly (this is no tale),
Hym to preserve from bestys wild and rage,
And after that token her viage
Toward Thebes in alle the hast they may.
But of fortune thilke same day
With her houndes serchyng up and doun,
The huntes went of kyng Poliboun
Thorgh the forest game forto fynde,
Some aforn and some cam behynde,
And gan serch and seke wonder sore
Among the hilles and the haltes hore.
And as they reenge the trenchis by and by,
They herde a noyse and a pitous cry
Of thys chyld hangyng on the tre,
And all at onys drowe forto se,
And lefte not to they han hym founde,
And toke hym doune and his fete unbounde,
And bare hym hom unto Polyboun,
Kyng of Archadye, the famous regioun.
And whan that he first the chyld gan see,
Of his woundes he hadde grete pyté
--**--**--
To beholde his tender fete so blede,
And called hym Edippus, as I rede,
Which is to seyn (platly this no phage)
Bored the feete, as in that langage.
And first the kyng in his royal halle
Made his men an norys forto calle,
This yonge chylde to foster and to kepe
With her milk that he nat ne wepe;
And his leches he charged ek also,
Til he were hool her dever forto do:
Fully in purpoos, for the child was fair,
After his day to maken hym his hayr
For cause only, who so taketh hede,
Sone hadde he noon be lyne to succede;
And wher that he had a wif or noon,
I fynde not and therfor lat it goon.
But by processe of dayes and of yeeris,
This Edyppus among his pleying feeris
Was in his port passyng ful of pride,
That non with hym myght in pees abide.
In hert he was so inly surquydows,
Malencolik, and contrarious,
Ful of despyt and of hegh disdeyn,
That no wight durst shortly hym withseyn;
Til on a day he gan with oon debate
To whoom he hadde specyaly grete hate,
Which of rancour and of hasty tene,
As he that myght his pride not sustene,
Gan upon hym cruelly abrayde,
And unto hym felly thus he saide.
--**--**--
"Wherto," quod he, "artow so proude of port,
Contrarie also ever in oure disport,
Froward and felle lastyng evere in oon,
As thow were lord of us everichon,
And presumest fully in wyrchyng,
Lik as thow were sone unto the kyng,
And descended of his royal blood?
But wher so be thow be wroth or wood,
Thow art no thing, and thow list take hede,
Appartenyng unto his kynrede
But in a forest founden and unknowe,
Whan thow were yonge. Therfor bere thee lowe!
And uttrely remembre, yif thee lyst,
Thy byrth and blood ar bothe two unwist.
This the fyne shortly of my tale."
Wherwith Edippus gan to wexe pale,
And chaunge also cheer and contenaunce,
And gan apoint in his remembraunce
Word be word and feyned right nought,
And felly mused in his owne thought,
And cast he wold withoute more tarying
The trouth enquere of Poliboun the kyng.
And whan he saugh opportune space
And the kyng in a sycré place,
He hym bysoghte lowly on his kne
To his request benignely to se,
And that he wolde pleynly, and not spare,
Of his byrth the trewe ground declare,
And make hym sure of this thyng anon
Yif he were his verrey sone or non.
--**--**--
And Polyboun only of gentilles,
Whan he beheeld the grete hevynesse
Of Edippus and the wooful peyne,
He gan dissimule and in manere feyne,
Lik as he had be verrely his heyre.
But mor and mor he falleth in dispeir
And doune on knees oft ageyn gan falle,
Hym conjuring be the goddes alle
To telle trouth and nothyng to hide,
Affermyng ek he wold nat abide
Lenger with hym but ryden and enquere,
Til tyme he may the verrey sothe lere
In eny part of hap or of fortune.
And for that he was so inportune
In his desire, the kyng without abood
Ceriously tolde how it stood,
In a forest first how he was founde
Upon a tre be the feet ybounde,
And how he caste, in conclusioun,
To make hym kyng of that regioun
Aftere his day shortly forto telle.
But Edippus wil no longer dwelle
But took lieve and in hast gan ryde
To a temple faste ther besyde
Of Appollo, in storie as is tolde,
Whos statue stood in a char of golde
Of wheles four boornyd bright and shene;
And within a spirit ful unclene,
Be fraude only and fals collusioun,
Answere gaf to every questioun,
--**--**--
Bryngyng the puple in ful gret errour,
Such as to hym dyden fals honour
Be rytys used in the olde dawes
Aftere custome of paganysmes lawes.
And Edyppus with ful humble chere
To Appollo maked his preiere,
Besechyng hym on his knees lowe
Be some signe that he myghte knowe,
Thorg evidence shortly comprehendyd,
Of what kynrede that he was discendyd.
And whan Edyppus be gret devocioun
Fynysshed hath fully his orysoun,
The fend anon withinnen invisyble
With a vois dredful and horrible
Bad hym in hast taken his viage
Toward Thebes wher of his lynage
He heren shal and be certefied.
And on his way anon he hath hym hyed,
By hasty journé so his hors constreyned
Day be day til he hath atteyned
Unto a castel Pylotes ycalled,
Rich and strong and wel aboute walled,
Adjacent be syyt of the contré
And perteynent to Thebes the cyté:
Kyng Layus beyng ther present
Forto holde a maner tornement
With his knyghtes yong and coraious
And other folkes that were desyrous
To preve hemsilf, shortly forto telle,
Who by force oyther myght excelle
--**--**--
Or gete a name thorgh his hegh prouesse.
Everich of hem dyd his bysynesse
On horsbak and also ek en foote,
Al be that some founde ful unsoote
(Rather a pley of werre than of pees),
Wher Edyppus put hymsilf in prees,
As he that was ay redy to debat,
Enforsyng hym to entren at the gate,
Maugré all tho that hym wolde lette.
And in the pres of aventure he mette
Kyng Layus and cruelly hym slogh,
Thow the story writ not the maner howh,
Ne no wight can of alle the companye
Be no signe verrely espye
By whos hond that the kyng was slawe;
For Edyppus in hast gan hym withdrawe
And kept hym coy of entencioun.
Gret was the noyse and the pitous soun
In the castel for slaughter of the kyng,
Dooel and compleynt, sorowe and wepyng.
But for they segh hevynesse and thoght
Ageynes deth vayleth lit or noght,
They ordeyne with ryytys ful royal
For the feste called funeral.
And lik the custom of the dayes olde,
The corps they brent into asshes colde,
And in a vessel rounde, mad as a bal,
They closed hem in gold and in metal.
And after that did her bysy cure
In Thebes to make a sepulture,
--**--**--
And richely, hem list no longer lette,
The asshen did they enclose and shette:
Of this matere ther nys no mor to seyn.
But to Edippus I wil retourne ageyn,
Which hym enhasteth ay fro day to day
Towardes Thebes in al that evere he may,
Brennyng in herte hoot as eny fire
The fyn to knowe of his fatal desire.
But for that he failed of a guyde,
Out of his way he wente fer beside
Thorgh a wylde and a waast contré,
By a mounteyn that stood upon the see,
Wher that monstres of many dyvers kynde
Were conversaunt, in story as I fynde;
Amonges which sothly ther was on,
So inly cruel that no man durst gon
For drede of deth forby that passage.
This monstre was so mortal in his rage,
Which hadde also, be descripcioun,
Body and feet of a fers lyoun;
And lik a mayde in soth was hede and face,
Fel of his look and cruel to manace,
And odyous of countenaunce and sight;
And as I rede, Spynx this monstre hight,
Wors than tygre, dragon, or serpent.
And I suppose by enchauntement
He was ordeyned on the hyl t'abyde,
To sleen all tho that passeden besyde
And specially all that diden fayle
To expowne his mysty dyvynaile,
--**--**--
His problem ek in wordes pleyn and bare
Withoute avys opynly declare,
Or with the lif he myghte not eskape:
This verray soth platly and no jape.
And yif that he, be declaracioun,
Gaf therupon cleer exposicioun,
He shuld in hast - there was non other mene -
Sleen this monstre for al his cruel tene:
Ther may of mercy be non other graunte.
But of al this Edyppus ignoraunte,
This dredful hill stondyng on a roche,
Er he was war, gan ful nygh approche,
More perilous platly than he wende.
And sodeynly the monster can descende
To stoppen his way and letten his passage,
Thus abraydyng with a fel corage:
"I have in herte inly gret disport
That fortune hath broght thee to my sort
To make a preef yif thow mayst endure
The fatal ende of this aventure,
Set at a fyn sothly be daies olde."
And by and by al the caas hym tolde,
Charging hym to be wel war and wise,
Gete the palme and bere away the pryse
Touchyng this thyng sette atwene us tweyn,
With lyf or deth which we shal dareyn.
And this monstre with a despitous chere
His problem gan thus, as ye shal here.
"Ther is a beest merveilous to se,
The which in soth at his nativyté
--**--**--
Is of his myght so tender and so grene
That he may hymsilve nat sustene
Upon his fete, thogh he hadde it sworn,
But yif that he be of his moder born.
And afterwardes be processe of age,
On foure fete he maketh his passage;
After on thre, if I shal not feyne,
And alderlast he goth upright on tweyne,
Dyvers of port and wonderful of cherys,
Til, be length of many sondry yeeres,
Naturely he goth ageyn on thre,
And sith on foure (it may non other be)
And fynaly (this the trouthe pleyn)
He retourneth kyndely ageyn
To the matere which that he kam fro.
Loo her is al my problem is ido.
Muse herupon withoute werre or stryff
It to declare or ellis lese thy lyff."
And whan Edyppus gan this thing adverte,
Wel assured in his manly herte,
Gan in his wytt cerchen up and doun,
And of prudence cast in his resoun
Be grete avis what thyng this may be,
Seyng also that he may not flee,
And how ther was counsel noon ne rede,
But telle trouth or ellys to be dede,
And be ful good deliberacioun
Thus he answerd in conclusioun.
"Thowe Spynx," quod he, "fals and fraudulent,
Thow vyle monstre, thow dragon, thow serpent,
--**--**--
Which on this hyl lich as I conceyve,
Lyst in awaite folkes to deceyve,
But truste wel, for al thy sleghty wit,
Thy fals fraude shal anon be qwyt.
Me list not nowe whisper neither rowne,
But thy problem I shal anon expowne
So opynly thow shalt not go therfro.
Loo, this it is - tak good hede therto.
Thilke best thow spak of hertoforn,
Is every man in this world yborn,
Which may not gon (his lymes be so softe),
Bot as his moder bereth hym alofte
In her armes, whan he doth crye and wepe.
And after that he gynneth forto crepe
On foure feet in his tendre youth,
B'experience as it is ofte kouth,
Aforn yrekned his hondes bothe two.
And by processe, thow mayst consider also
With his two fete, for al thy felle tene,
He hath a staf hymselven to sustene,
And than he goth shortly upon thre.
And altherlast, as it most nedes be,
Voyding his staf, he walketh upon tweyn,
Til it so he thorgh age he atteyn,
That lust of youthe wasted be and spent;
Than in his hond he taketh a potent,
And on thre feet thus he goth ageyn -
I dar afferme thow maist it not withseyn -
And sone aftere thorgh his unweldy myght,
By influence of Naturys right,
--**--**--
B'experience as every man may knowe,
Lich a child on foure he crepeth lowe.
And for he may no whyl here sojourne,
To erth ageyn he most in hast retourne,
Which he kam fro - he may it not remewe.
For in this world no man may eschewe
(This verray soth shortly and no doute)
Whan the wheel of kynde cometh aboute
And naturely hath his cours yronne
Be circuete, as doth the shene sonne,
That man and chyld of hegh and lowe estat,
It geyneth nat to make mor debat,
His tyme sette that he moste fyne,
Whan Antropos of malice doth untwyne
His lyves thred by Cloto first compowned.
Loo, her thy problem fully is expowned,
At oure metynge as I took on honde,
To the lawe that thow most nedes stonde
And in al hast of myn hondes deye,
But of reson thow can it ought withseye."
And so this Spynx, awapyd and amaat,
Stood disamayed and dysconsolaat
With chier dounecast muet, pale, and ded.
And Edippus anon smote of the hed
Of this fende stynkyng and unswete,
And the contré sette holy in quyete,
Wherby he hath such a pris ywonne
That his fame is every cost yronne
Thorgh al the londe that he the monstre hath slawe.
And lyneright to Thebes he gan drawe,
--**--**--
Wel receyved for his worthynesse,
For his manhode and his grete prouesse.
And for they segh he was a semly knyght,
Wel favoured in every mannys sight,
And sawh also Thebes the myghty toun,
Not only they but al the regioun,
Weren destitut of a governour,
Ageynst her foon havyng no socour
Hem to defend but the quene allon,
Among hemself makyng ful gret mon,
For heire was non, as bookes specifie,
The sceptre or crowne forto occupie,
For which the lordes all be on assent
Withinne the toun set a parlement,
Shortly concludyng, if it myghte ben,
Prudently to trete with the quene,
Namely they that helde hemsilf most sage,
To condescende be way of mariage
She to be joyned to this manly knyght,
Passing prudent and famous ek of myght,
Most likly man, as they can discerne,
The worthy cyté to kepen and governe.
And thorgh counsayl of the lordes alle
To her desyre pleynly she is falle
And accorded withoute mor tarying
That of Thebes Edippus shal be kyng
By ful assent - was non that seide nay.
And tyme set ageyn a certeyn day
Among hemsilf and finaly devysed,
The weddyng was in Thebes solempnyzed
--**--**--
Ful ryally, which nedes most unthryve,
Only for he his moder toke to wyve,
Unwist of both he was of her blode,
And ignoraunt, shortly, how it stode
That he toforn hadde his fadere slawe,
For which this weddyng was ageyn the lawe.
And tofor God is neither feire ne good
Nor acceptable blood to touche blood,
Which cause hath ben of gret confusioun
In many londe and many regyoun,
Grounde and roote of unhap and meschaunce,
The fyn concludyng alway with vengeaunce,
As men han seie by cleer experience.
And holy writ recordeth in sentence
How Herodes falsly in his lyff
By violence toke his brother wyf,
For she was faire and plesaunt to his sight,
And kepte her stille be fors thorgh his myght,
Al be to her he hadde title non;
And for her sake the holy man Seynt John
For his trouth in prison lost his hede.
Therfor I rede every man take hede,
Wherso he be prynce, lorde, or kyng,
That he be war t'eschewe such weddyng,
Er that the swerde of vengeaunce hym manace,
Lest he lese hap, fortune, and grace,
Takyng ensample in al manere thynge
Of Edyppus in Thebes crowned kyng,
Al be that he wroght of ignoraunce,
Ful derk and blynde of his woful chaunce.
--**--**--
And yif unwist he of innocence,
As ye han herde, fil in such offence,
For which he was punished and brought lowe,
What ar they worthy that her errour knowe
And fro the knotte list not to abstene
Of such spousale, to God and man unclene?
I can not seyn nor mor therof devise.
Demeth yoursilf that prudent ben and wise
And Edippus hath among in mynde,
Of whom the weddyng, lik as ye may fynde,
Unhappy was and passing odious,
Infortuned and ungracious.
I am wery mor therof to write;
The hatful processe also to endyte
I passe over, fully of entent.
For Ymeneus was not ther present,
Nor Lucyna list not ther to shyne,
Ne ther was none of the Musys nyne
By on accord to make melodye
(For ther song not be hevenly armonye),
Neither Clyo nor Calyopé,
On of the sustren in nombre thries thre,
As they dyde whan Philolegye
Ascendid up hegh above the skye
To be weddid, this lady vertuous,
Unto hir lord the god Mercurius,
As Marcian ynamed de Capelle
In his book of weddyng can you telle,
Ther concludyng in this mariage
The poete that whilom was so sage
--**--**--
That this lady, called Sapience,
Iwedded was unto Eloquence,
As it sat wel, by hevenly purveaunce,
Hem to be joyned be knot of aliaunce.
But bothe two, sothly, of entent
At the weddyng in Thebes were absent,
That caused after grete adversité.
For fynal eende of that solempnyté
Was sorowe and woo and destruccioun,
Utter ruyne of this royal toun.
Ther may no man helpe it nor socoure,
For a tyme in joye thogh they floure.
But at this weddyng, platly forto telle,
Was Cerberus, chief porter of helle;
And Herebus, fader to hatrede,
Was ther present with his hool kynrede,
His wiff also with her browes blake,
And her doghtren sorow forto make,
Hydous-chered and uggely forto see,
Megera and Thesiphonee,
Allecto ek with Labour and Envie,
Drede and Fraude and Fals Trecherie,
Tresoun, Poverté, Indigence, and Nede,
And cruel Deth in his rente wede,
Wrechednesse, Compleynt, and eke Rage,
Ferful pale Derknesse, croked Age,
Cruel Mars as eny tygre wood,
Brennyng ire of unkynde blood,
Fraternal Hate depe sett the rote,
Save only deth that ther nas no bote,
--**--**--
Assuryd othes at the fyn untrewe:
All thise folk weren at this weddyng newe,
To make the towne desolat and bare,
As the story after shal declare.
But ay in Thebes with his walles stronge
Edyppus regneth many day and longe.
And as myn autour writ in wordys pleyn,
By Jocasta he had sones tweyn,
Ethyocles and also Polymyte,
And, in bokes as sondry clerkes write,
Doghtres two ful goodly on to se,
Of which the ton hight Antygone,
And that other called was Ymeyne,
Of her beauté inly sovereyn.
Edyppus, ay devoyde of werre and strif,
With Jocasta ladde a mery lyf
Tyl fortune of her iniquyté
Hadde envie of his prosperité.
For whan he shon most riche in his renoun,
From her wheel she plonged hym adoun
Out of his joye into sodeyn wo,
As she is wonte frowardly to do,
And namely hem that setten her affiaunce
Of erthly trust in her variaunce.
For whan this kyng passing of gret myght,
Sat with the quene upon a certeyn nyght,
Casuelly whan his folk echon
Out of chambre sodeynly wer gon,
Or he was war Jocasta gan byholde
The carectys of his woundes olde,
--**--**--
Upon his fete enprented wonder depe,
Turnyng her face brast out forto wepe
So secrely he myght it not espie.
And she anon fille into a fantasie,
Ay on thys thyng musyng mor and more,
And in her bed gan to sighe sore.
And whan the kyng conceyveth her distresse,
He gan enquere of her hevynesse
Fully the cause and occasioun,
For he wil wite, in conclusioun,
What her eileth and why she ferde so.
"My lorde," quod she, "withoute wordes mo,
Parcel cause of this sodeyn rage
Is for that I in my tender age
Had a lorde inamed Layus,
Kyng of this toune, a man right vertuus,
Be whom I hadde a sone wonder fair,
Likly tabene his successour and hair;
But by cause his dyvynours tolde
At his birthe sothly that he sholde,
Yif he have lyf, be fatal destanyé
Sleen his fader (it may non other be);
For which the king his fate to eschewe
Bad me in hast, as hym thoghte dewe,
To sle the childe and have therof no routh.
And I anon bad withoute slouth
To certeyn men, up peyne of jugemente,
To execute the comaundemente
Of the king, as I gaf hem in charge.
And forth they gon to a forest large
--**--**--
Adjacent unto this contré,
Percen his fete, and honge hym on a tre,
Nat parfourmyng th'execucioun:
(On hym they hadde such compassioun),
Lefte hym ther, and hom resort ageyn,
Beyng in doute and in non certeyn
At theyre repeire, as they tolden alle,
Of this childe what afterward is falle,
Save they saide huntys han hym founde,
Which lad hym forth and his feet unbounde
But to what coost they coude not declare.
Which parcel is of myn evel fare,
Grounde and cause of myn hevy chere,
Considred ek the woundes that appere
Upon youre fete, and woot not what they mene.
And on thyng ay is at myn herte grene,
My lord, allas, but of newe date:
Kyng Layus slayen was but late
At a castel nygh by this contré,
Upon youre comyng into this cité.
Al this yweied and rekned into on
Maketh myn herte hevy as a ston,
So that I can counsel non nor rede."
And with that word the kyng lift up his hede,
And abrayd with sharpe sighes smerte,
And al this thing be ordre gan adverte,
Ceriously be good avisement,
And by signes cleer and evident
Conceyveth wel, and sore gan repente
It was hymsilf that Jocasta mente.
--**--**--
And whan the quene in manere segh hym pleyn,
By her goddes she gan hym to constreyne
To shewen out the cause of his affray,
And it expowne, and make no delay,
Crop and root shortly, why that he
Entred first into that contré,
Fro when he kam and fro what regioun.
But he hir put in dilusioun,
As he had done it for the nonys,
Til at laste he brak out atonys
Unto the queene and gan a processe make
First how he was in the forest take,
Wounded the feet and so forth everythyng,
Of his chershing with Polyboun the kyng,
And hool the cause why he hym forsoke,
And in what wise he the weye toke
Toward Thebes as Appollo bad,
And of fortune how that he was lad
Wher that Spynx kepte the mounteyn;
And how that he slough also in certeyn
Kyng Layus at the castel gate,
Towardes nyght whan it was ful late;
And how to Thebes that he gan hym spede
To fynden oute the stok of his kynrede:
Which unto hym gan to wexe couth;
For by processe of his grene youth
He fonde out wel, be reknyng of his lif,
That she was both his moder and his wif.
So that al nyght and suing on the morow
Atwene hem two gan a newe sorowe,
--**--**--
Which unto me were tedious to telle;
For therupon, yif I shulde dwelle,
A long space it wolde occupie.
But ye may reden in a tragedye
Of moral Senyk fully his endynge,
His dool, his meschief, and his compleynyng,
How with sorow and unweldy age
This Edippus fille into dotage,
Lost his wit and his worldly delit,
And how his sones had hym in despit,
